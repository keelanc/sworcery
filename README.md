Sworcery
===============
_by Keelan Chu For_

A watchface for the Pebble smartwatch, based on the excellent video game [Sword & Sworcery](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/).

Download the [sworcery.pbw app here](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=1736&aName=kchuffle&pageTitle=Sworcery&auID=1379).

There a different animations on app launch, every 15 seconds, and on the minute change. The moon updates its phase once a day.

I'm considering adding different game characters for different hours, like the Grizzled Boor.
